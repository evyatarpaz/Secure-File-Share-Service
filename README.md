# Secure-File-Share-Service
Secure "One-Time" File Sharing Service (Mini-WeTransfer) The Practical Problem: Companies often need to send sensitive files (logs, keys, contracts) to external clients. Email is insecure, and giving full S3/Drive access is too risky. The Solution: A service where users upload a file and get a link that works only once or expires after 1 hour.
